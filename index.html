                <p class="aside__content">
                    In 1933 in New York, an enterprise known as Marvel Publishing was founded by Martin Goodman. Six
                    years later, in 1939, he established a comic book newspaper named Timely Comics. The first of the
                    comic book heroes was Captain America. Following the successful launch of the character, the
                    publishing house began to expand gradually and create other characters. In 1950, the company's name
                    was changed to Atlas Comics. However, readers were becoming less inclined to purchase comics with
                    the same heroes, and eventually, after financial troubles emerged, the publishing house's name was
                    changed in the latter half of the 1950s to a more universal and distinctive name â€“ Marvel Comics
                    (the publishing house continues under this name to this day). The 1960s were known as the golden era
                    for Marvel, called "The Marvel age of comics." In November 1961, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby published
                    the first issue of the Fantastic Four[1]. In 1962, Spider-Man made his debut in the anthology
                    Amazing Fantasy. This character gained immense popularity among comic book readers, making the
                    company the largest of its kind in the USA. Today, Spider-Man is one of the symbols of global pop
                    culture. Lee and Kirby collaborated again in 1963 and created the group of mutants known as the
                    X-Men. Since then, Marvel has become the largest American comic book publisher, surpassing its
                    longtime competitor DC Comics.
                </p>

                <p class="aside__content">Currently, Marvel Comics (sometimes referred to as Marvel Publishing) is one
                    of the branches of Marvel Entertainment, which is involved in the production of comics, movies, and
                    series with franchise characters under the Marvel Studios and Marvel Animation brands. The company
                    also established a holding called Marvel Toys that produces toys featuring Marvel characters,
                    including Spider-Man and Iron Man.
                </p>

                <p class="aside__content">On August 31, 2009, it was announced that Marvel Entertainment would become
                    part of the media giant â€“ The Walt Disney Company. Later calculations revealed that Disney acquired
                    the company for approximately 4.5 billion USD. The transaction officially concluded on December 31,
                    2009, after legal verifications by officials.
                </p>
                <p class="aside__content">By November 2014, Marvel had published over 43,000 comic book issues, while DC
                    Comics â€“ 44,000.
                </p>
                <p class="aside__content">In September 2015, Marvel Studios was directly integrated into Walt Disney
                    Studios. Marvel Television and Marvel Animation remained within Marvel Entertainment.

        <h2 class="section__header">15 fun facts about Marvel movies</h2>
        <ol class="section__list">
            <li class="section__listItem">We start with interesting news, which we affectionately called fresh. Good
                news for
                Wolverine fans. If
                you shed a sea of â€‹â€‹tears in the cinema after Logan's death, we hasten to inform you that your despair
                was premature. Those who sensed that it was not over yet, can be proud of themselves. Wolverine can be
                seen on the pages of <strong>Marvel Legacy.</strong> The favorite mutant (e.g. of Good Loot) will
                return, holding the
                infinity stone in his hand, the same one currently hunted by the Guardians of the Galaxy. This is a
                detail, the important thing is that (at least in the comic) we can meet Logan once again ... And
                everything indicates that his return will not be a one-time incident. <strong>The Marvel Legacy</strong>
                series starts on
                September 27.</li>
            <li class="section__listItem">Another interesting fact concerns the movie <strong>Logan</strong>. Well, the
                filmmakers have an
                appetite for an Oscar.
                Reportedly, 20th Century Fox sent out a DVD of the footage to members of the academy. It'd be great!
                What do you think?</li>
            <li class="section__listItem">Question - a riddle. Which <i>superhero</i> film turned out to be the
                highest-grossing
                production of 2017,
                grossing $874 million? Attention, we give the answer; <strong>Spider-Man: Homecoming.</strong> On this
                occasion, you can
                legally watch the first 10 minutes of the film online: <a class="section__links"

            </li>
            <li class="section__listItem">Do you remember that on October 25, the premiere of the new
                <strong>Thor</strong> in
                Polish cinemas?
                There is a chance
                that we will see Matt Damon in the Marvel production. According to reports, he would appear in a cameo
                role as a stage actor playing Loki. We don't know about you, but we want to see it!
            </li>
            <li class="section__listItem">Are you also looking forward to the third part of the <strong>Guardians of the
                    Galaxy</strong>
                adventures? The director
                of the series, James Gunn, blurted out on social media and when asked by a fan about a possible release
                date, he replied that it would happen within three years. So plan your next meeting with the
                <strong>Guardians</strong>
                for 2020!
            </li>
            <li class="section__listItem">That's enough fresh news, let's move on to the trivia from the
                classics of the genre!
                Let's go back 9
                years to the movie <strong>Iron Man</strong> for a moment. Have you noticed (while watching) that one of
                the scenes
                filmed in Tony Stark's garage shows the unfinished shield of Captain America? Such about: <a
                    class="section__links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
                    href="https://goodloot.pl/data/FILE-20170929-1134CRJ49AH9W7W1.jpg"
                    title="You can see here shield of Captain of America">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></li>
            <li class="section__listItem">The shield is a faithful companion of Steve Rogers, it always comes back, it
                is always
                at hand. The
                comics explain this phenomenon, so it returns to the superhero thanks to the magnets attached to it.
                However, Rogers had to give up this solution when facing <strong>Magneto.</strong></li>
            <li class="section__listItem">Here comes another curiosity from the comic universe. During Captain America's
                battles
                with Magneto;
                Rogers' opponent was unable to control the shield itself (it's a pity that Wolverine
                wasn't so lucky
                when meeting Magneto).</li>
            <li class="section__listItem">As you probably remember in the movie <strong>The Incredible Hulk</strong>,
                the role
                of Bruce Banner
                was played by Edward
                Norton, who was replaced by Mark Ruffalo in The <strong>Avengers</strong>. Why? There are personal games
                and money behind
                this decision. Kevin Feige of Marvel Studios described the actor as a "prima donna" and complained about
                the lack of cohesion with the entire team. What do you think about this change in retrospect?</li>
            <li class="section__listItem">In <strong>The Avengers</strong>, Dr. Banner confesses that he wanted to
                commit
                suicide. This is a
                reference to the
                production of <strong>The Incredible Hulk</strong>, in which the character played by Norton at the time
                intends to shoot
                himself in the head to prevent turning into the Hulk. However, you won't find the scene in the video as
                it was eventually deleted.</li>
            <li class="section__listItem">In the Avengers movies, Hulk's body was computer-generated based on Steve
                Romm's
                bodybuilder and
                stripper. The face of the green hero received the features of the actor Mark Ruffalo
                playing him.</li>
            <li class="section__listItem">In the movie <strong>Avengers: Age of Ultron</strong>, the actress
                playing Black Widow,
                we are talking about Scarlett
                Johansson, of course, was pregnant. Therefore, on the set, she was often assisted by understudies,
                supposedly so similar to the actress that even the crew members were wrong. We are
                shocked - there is
                only one Scarlett!</li>
            <li class="section__listItem">You remember the part of the superhero adventures where you will find the
                memorable
                scene where Rogers
                tries to lift Thor's hammer. By the son of Odin! Of course, he fails, although he is
                close. In the
                comics, however, this theme was played out differently - Captain America on the Marvel pages has no
                problem with it.</li>
            <li class="section__listItem">Speaking of Thor's hammer, it is worth mentioning that several versions of it
                are
                always created for the
                film. In the movie <strong>Thor: The Dark World</strong>, the team created as many as 30 models of it,
                each with a
                different weight and application, in stunt scenes, for example, it was made of soft material, while its
                basic version was made of aluminum.</li>
            <li class="section__listItem">Finally, we leave the matrimonial announcement: Scarlet Witch and
                Vision in the comic
                book world are
                married! ABOUT! We were looking for a positive accent to end our trivia, because
                initially we were
                supposed to write that Jane Foster and Thor's relationship did not pass the test of time and Natalie
                Portman fell out of the film universe.</li>

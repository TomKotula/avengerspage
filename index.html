            <h3 class="preMainH3">Marvel comics history</h3>

            <p class="preMainP">In mid-1961, following rival DC Comics' successful revival of superheroes a few
                years
                earlier, Goodman assigned his comics editor, Stan Lee, to follow the end again.
                He said, "Stan, we
                gotta
                put out a bunch of heroes. You know, there's a market for it." Lee's wife suggested that Lee
                experiment
                with stories he preferred, since he was planning on changing careers and had nothing to lose. In
                response,
                Lee and artist Jack Kirby created The Fantastic Four #1 (cover-dated Nov. 1961), giving their
                superheroes a
                flawed humanity in which they bickered, worried about money and behaved more like everyday people
                than
                noble
                archetypes. That series became the first major success of what would become Marvel Comics. The
                newly naturalistic comics changed the industry. Lee, Kirby, such artists as Steve
                Ditko, Don Heck,
                Dick
                Ayers, John Romita Sr., Gene Colan, and John Buscema, and eventually writers including Roy Thomas
                and
                Archie
                Goodwin, ushered in a string of hit characters, including Spider-Man, Iron Man, the
                Hulk, Daredevil,
                and
                the
                X-Men.</p>

            <p class="preMainP">In fall 1968, Goodman sold Magazine Management to the Perfect Film & Chemical
                Corporation. Goodman remained
                as publisher until 1972, which included supporting Lee's decision to disregard the Comics Code
                Authority's disallowance of an The Amazing Spider-Man anti-drug themed story-arc requested by the US
                Department of Health, Education and Welfare, which discredited the censor. Two years later he
                founded a
                new comics company, Seaboard Periodicals, which published under a new Atlas Comics imprint and is
                known
                to
                collectors as "Atlas/Seaboard Comics". It shut down the following year.</p>

            <p class="preMainP">Perfect Film & Chemical renamed itself Cadence Industries in 1973,
                the first of many
                post-Goodman changes,
                mergers, and acquisitions that led to what became the 21st-century corporation Marvel Entertainment
                Group.

        <h3 class="sectionH3">15 fun facts about Marvel movies</h3>
        <ol class="sectionOl">
            <li class="sectionLi">We start with interesting news, which we affectionately called fresh. Good news for
                Wolverine fans. If
                you shed a sea of â€‹â€‹tears in the cinema after Logan's death, we hasten to inform you that your despair
                was premature. Those who sensed that it was not over yet, can be proud of themselves. Wolverine can be
                seen on the pages of <strong>Marvel Legacy.</strong> The favorite mutant (e.g. of Good Loot) will
                return, holding the
                infinity stone in his hand, the same one currently hunted by the Guardians of the Galaxy. This is a
                detail, the important thing is that (at least in the comic) we can meet Logan once again ... And
                everything indicates that his return will not be a one-time incident. <strong>The Marvel Legacy</strong>
                series starts on
                September 27.</li>
            <li class="sectionLi">Another interesting fact concerns the movie <strong>Logan</strong>. Well, the
                filmmakers have an
                appetite for an Oscar.
                Reportedly, 20th Century Fox sent out a DVD of the footage to members of the academy. It'd be great!
                What do you think?</li>
            <li class="sectionLi">Question - a riddle. Which <i>superhero</i> film turned out to be the highest-grossing
                production of 2017,
                grossing $874 million? Attention, we give the answer; <strong>Spider-Man: Homecoming.</strong> On this
                occasion, you can
                legally watch the first 10 minutes of the film online: <a

            </li>
            <li class="sectionLi">Do you remember that on October 25, the premiere of the new <strong>Thor</strong> in
                Polish cinemas?
                There is a chance
                that we will see Matt Damon in the Marvel production. According to reports, he would appear in a cameo
                role as a stage actor playing Loki. We don't know about you, but we want to see it!</li>
            <li class="sectionLi">Are you also looking forward to the third part of the <strong>Guardians of the
                    Galaxy</strong>
                adventures? The director
                of the series, James Gunn, blurted out on social media and when asked by a fan about a possible release
                date, he replied that it would happen within three years. So plan your next meeting with the
                <strong>Guardians</strong>
                for 2020!
            </li>
            <li class="sectionLi">That's enough fresh news, let's move on to the trivia from the
                classics of the genre!
                Let's go back 9
                years to the movie <strong>Iron Man</strong> for a moment. Have you noticed (while watching) that one of
                the scenes
                filmed in Tony Stark's garage shows the unfinished shield of Captain America? Such about: <a
                    target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"
                    href="https://goodloot.pl/data/FILE-20170929-1134CRJ49AH9W7W1.jpg"
                    title="You can see here shield of Captain of America">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a></li>
            <li class="sectionLi">The shield is a faithful companion of Steve Rogers, it always comes back, it is always
                at hand. The
                comics explain this phenomenon, so it returns to the superhero thanks to the magnets attached to it.
                However, Rogers had to give up this solution when facing <strong>Magneto.</strong></li>
            <li class="sectionLi">Here comes another curiosity from the comic universe. During Captain America's battles
                with Magneto;
                Rogers' opponent was unable to control the shield itself (it's a pity that Wolverine
                wasn't so lucky
                when meeting Magneto).</li>
            <li class="sectionLi">As you probably remember in the movie <strong>The Incredible Hulk</strong>, the role
                of Bruce Banner
                was played by Edward
                Norton, who was replaced by Mark Ruffalo in The <strong>Avengers</strong>. Why? There are personal games
                and money behind
                this decision. Kevin Feige of Marvel Studios described the actor as a "prima donna" and complained about
                the lack of cohesion with the entire team. What do you think about this change in retrospect?</li>
            <li class="sectionLi">In <strong>The Avengers</strong>, Dr. Banner confesses that he wanted to commit
                suicide. This is a
                reference to the
                production of <strong>The Incredible Hulk</strong>, in which the character played by Norton at the time
                intends to shoot
                himself in the head to prevent turning into the Hulk. However, you won't find the scene in the video as
                it was eventually deleted.</li>
            <li class="sectionLi">In the Avengers movies, Hulk's body was computer-generated based on Steve Romm's
                bodybuilder and
                stripper. The face of the green hero received the features of the actor Mark Ruffalo
                playing him.</li>
            <li class="sectionLi">In the movie <strong>Avengers: Age of Ultron</strong>, the actress
                playing Black Widow,
                we are talking about Scarlett
                Johansson, of course, was pregnant. Therefore, on the set, she was often assisted by understudies,
                supposedly so similar to the actress that even the crew members were wrong. We are
                shocked - there is
                only one Scarlett!</li>
            <li class="sectionLi">You remember the part of the superhero adventures where you will find the memorable
                scene where Rogers
                tries to lift Thor's hammer. By the son of Odin! Of course, he fails, although he is
                close. In the
                comics, however, this theme was played out differently - Captain America on the Marvel pages has no
                problem with it.</li>
            <li class="sectionLi">Speaking of Thor's hammer, it is worth mentioning that several versions of it are
                always created for the
                film. In the movie <strong>Thor: The Dark World</strong>, the team created as many as 30 models of it,
                each with a
                different weight and application, in stunt scenes, for example, it was made of soft material, while its
                basic version was made of aluminum.</li>
            <li class="sectionLi">Finally, we leave the matrimonial announcement: Scarlet Witch and
                Vision in the comic
                book world are
                married! ABOUT! We were looking for a positive accent to end our trivia, because
                initially we were
                supposed to write that Jane Foster and Thor's relationship did not pass the test of time and Natalie
                Portman fell out of the film universe.</li>
